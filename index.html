        <p>After years of combatting synthetic cannabinoids, also known as K2, Lincoln police, lawmakers, health officials and other stakeholders might have resolved the issue.</p><p>In March of 2016, lawmakers adopted LB1009. According to Chris Peterson, Narcotics Captain for the Lincoln Police Department, the bill dismantles the business opportunity of K2 rather than scheduling substances. </p><p>In the past, lawmakers scheduled the chemicals used to produce K2 as illegal substances, but manufacturers would skirt legislation by replacing the newly scheduled chemical with a legal chemical. The shift in chemicals to avoid these drugs laws resulted in a string of “bad batches.” Lincoln police reported 50 overdoses in April of 2015 due a bad batch. LB1009 outlawed the manufacturing, distribution and possession of all types of synthetic cannabinoids.</p>

        <p>Kali Smith, who founded the Tyler Smith Purple Project after his son took his own life while under the influence of K2, described LB1009 as the best piece of legislation in the country.</p><p>Lincoln has seen a drop in citations and availability of K2 since the passage of the bill. Lincoln police have only given out 93 citations in 2016 so far, compared to 221 citations in 2014 and 118 citations in 2015 within the same time period. Lincoln police have only recorded two overdoses in all of 2016, compared to the 50 in April of 2015.</p>

        <p>Data from the Lincoln Police Department shows an overall decrease in synthetic marijuana citations since 2014 and 2015. Arrests are still being made for possession of K2, Smith said the current availability of K2 could stem from Council Bluffs, with Iowa’s lackadaisical laws on the substance, but this has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>“They (the stakeholders) took advice to heart. It’s less about making money and more concerned about public health and doing what’s right.” Peterson said.</p><p>Peterson said because of the drop-off, K2 is no longer a front and center issue for local authorities. Authorities can now turn their attention to the ongoing methamphetamine problem and the current heroin epidemic in the United States. He said Lincoln has only recently encountered the heroin issue, but it’s not as prominent compared to cities on the coast. Law makers and authorities have kept a close eye on that issue in recent months.</p><p>Joe Fraas, owner of G & G Smoke Shop, located across the street from where Dirt Cheap once was, said stores are no longer selling the drug.</p><p>Manufacturers offered Fraas the drug as incense and was under the impression that the incense was just another herbal product. He didn’t realize the product was used as a drug.</p><p>Frass said after local and national newspapers ran stories on K2, business exploded and G & G was making up to $60,000 a month. After legislation was passed and customers were having severe side effects, Fraas ripped the product off his shelves.</p><p>All of his business went across the street to Dirt Cheap.</p><p>Customers would wait for Dirt Cheap to open in the morning. Fraas said some mornings up to 30 people would be waiting outside for the doors to open.</p><p>“The fact that these [explicit] across the street from us continue selling and see these people coming in everyday just blows my mind,” Fraas said. “I don’t care how much money there is in something.”</p>

        <p>The American Association for Poison Control Centers reported received a total of 3,682 in 2014 in regards to K2, but calls increased to 7,794 in 2015 due to an increase in popularity. So far in 2016 those numbers have decreased to 2,228 as of October 31. Joan McVoy, Registered Nurse for the American Association for Poison Control Centers, said education efforts by professionals and advocates, such as Smith, influenced the decrease in popularity.</p><p>Smith is now advocating to pass a legislation similar to Nebraska’s LB1009. She is unsure on who will present the bill to congress. She said the bill might not be presented by a Nebraska senator and is unsure if the bill will change when presented or remain as LB1009</p><p>“Adapt ours or don’t adapt ours, but let’s get something. Synthetic drug awareness, call it something, let’s just do something,” Smith said.</p>
